A theoretically cross-platform Discord Rich Presence Script for Team Fortress 2.

Tested on my Linux Manjaro machine, but should also work on other Linux distros, macOS and Windows.

**Windows support was done by [Kataiser](https://github.com/Kataiser), check them out!**
**JSON file made by [aUniqueUser](https://github.com/aUniqueUser/) check them out!**

Please open an issue if things go wrong.

> MAKE SURE TO LAUNCH TF2 WITH THE `-condebug` LAUNCH OPTION

##### Step 1) Have Python 3 installed.
Most Linux distros have Python 3 installed by default. You may have to install it on Windows or macOS.

Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or through your package manager.

##### Step 2) Clone this repo into a folder and install the dependencies.
Click clone. Open a Terminal / CMD / PowerShell inside the folder you cloned it into and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Afterwards, all you need to do is run `python main.py` and follow the prompts.
After setting your path the first time, you will not be asked again.
Delete `tf_path.txt` to reset your path.

If it complains about not being able to find a log file, make sure you have launched TF2 with the `-condebug` launch option and double check your path.


FAQ

##### Is this VAC safe?

Yes. It does not mess with any of your TF2 game files and runs independent of Team Fortress 2. It simply hooks onto the `console.log` file and processes the console output, then matches it up to events.

##### It keeps saying there is no log file found!

Make sure you are launching the game with the `-condebug` launch option. Launch options can be set by right-clicking Team Fortress 2 in your Steam Library, clicking properties, and clicking Set Launch Options. This launch option tells TF2 to leave a log file, which this program can then read.

##### When is the Heavy Update coming?
